## Combiobi
A tool that helps you run code in the <a href="https://github.com/ArtyomKingmang/Lazurite">Lazurite Programming language</a> in a jar or exe file.
To use Combiobi, you need to go to the Releases tab and download the files:

```java
----------------------------------------
        combiobiConsole.exe
//launching console programs on lazurite
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
        combiobiDesktop.exe
//launching desktop applications on lazurite
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
        combiobi.jar
//launching cross-platform applications on lazurite
----------------------------------------
```


## Startup instructions:

1)
```
create a file index.lzr and write the code you need.
```
2) 
```
place the file index.lzr in the directory along with the version of combiobi you need
```
3) 
```
   launch combiobi with a double click and enjoy the program
```
##Result
After all the operations, you can make an installer of your program and share it with friends (this can be done without an installer, but only if you send the exe/jar file along with the .lzr source code)
